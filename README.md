# Ca-legislature-explorations
Digging into publicly available data published by the California state legislature

Data is sourced from http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov

We were interested in seeing if we could see any unexpected voting patterns based on bill sponsorship. The reports in this project were a tool in this exploration. Sample outputs can be seen in the outputs directory.
